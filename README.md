Submitted by: **Greta Browne**

Time spent: **5.5** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] User can **view a list of todo items**
* [x] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [x] User's **list of items persisted** upon modification and and retrieved properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] User can **navigate up from editing item activity** to main activity via back button if they decide not to edit the item
* [x] User can more easily **use the keyboard immediately following adding an item** because of a change in position of the Add Item Toast/alert

## Notes

Changing the color of the action bar and other elements proved more difficult than expected; I decided to change the theme colors because this allowed for more straightforward color adjustments. Also, concepts that would seem simple, like making the list bulleted, I discovered are actually pretty complicated when using just ListView.
